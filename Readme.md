# I F*** RAT

The most revolutionary Remote Access Tool out there is here at your door.

> **Note**
> This is ofc not a revolutionary tool, it's just a generic software.

Tools Used:

- **.NET 7**: The .NET development platform, very cool SDK.
- **Discord.Net**: An Unofficial Discord API C# wrapper.

> **Warning**
> Against what you might thing, this is actually _not_ malware. This software has been written with the intent for someone to control their own Personal Computer remotely, no strings attached`*`.

`*`: ***Check your hands before assuming this is true***
